# 🔤 Auto-Complete System (Console-Based) in C++

A simple and efficient console-based Auto-Complete System implemented in C++ using the **Trie data structure**. It reads a list of words from a dictionary file and provides word suggestions based on user input prefix.

### 2. **Add Words to Dictionary**

Edit `data/dictionary.txt` and add one word per line.

Example:

```
cat
car
call

camera
camp
```

### 3. **Compile the Project**

```bash
make
```

### 4. **Run the Executable**

```bash
./autocomplete
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Dictionary Load:**
   - All words from `dictionary.txt` are read at startup and inserted into a Trie.
2. **Trie Insertion:**
   - Each character of the word is added as a node in the Trie.
   - Terminal nodes mark the end of valid words.
3. **User Input:**
   - The user types a prefix.
   - The system searches the Trie for all words starting with that prefix.
4. **Suggestions:**
   - A list of suggestions is returned and printed in the console.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- 🔢 **Frequency-Based Suggestions:**
  - Rank suggestions by how frequently each word is used.
- 🎨 **Colored Console Output:**
  - Use colored text to improve user experience.
- ✨ **Real-Time Suggestions:**
  - Show suggestions instantly as the user types (without pressing Enter).
- 🌐 **Interactive CLI Enhancements:**
  - Arrow-key navigation, pagination for large suggestion lists.
- 📦 **Command-Line Arguments:**
  - Allow user to pass dictionary file path as an argument.
- 🧪 **Unit Testing:**
  - Add test cases for insertions, prefix searches, and edge cases.
