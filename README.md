# 🛠️ My DSA Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! Here, I will document my daily progress as I learn, solve problems, and refine my skills in DSA. The journey focuses on **conceptual clarity**, **problem-solving in C++ and Java**.

---

## 🌟 Weekly Plan

**Monday - Tuesday**

- Solve DSA problems in **C++**.
- Focus on understanding new concepts and applying them.

**Wednesday**

- Revise and practice the problems solved on Monday-Tuesday in **Java**.
- Reinforce logic by implementing the same solutions in a new language.

**Thursday - Friday**

- Continue solving problems in **C++**, diving into more advanced topics or refining previous ones.

**Saturday**

- Revise and practice Thursday-Friday problems in **Java**, reinforcing concepts through repetition.

## 💡 Goals

1. **Concept Mastery:** Understand each topic thoroughly before moving to the next.
2. **Multi-Language Fluency:** Solve problems in C++ and Java to deepen understanding and improve adaptability.
3. **Consistent Progress:** Push daily updates to this repository to track progress and stay accountable.
